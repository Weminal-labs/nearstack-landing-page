## Staked Assets (sAssets)
sAssets are liquid, tokenized representations of staked (bonded) assets PoS blockchain. They provide stakeholders with liquidity over their staked assets, allowing the locked value of staked assets to be used in financial applications.

In Orchai Liquid Staking, there are two types of sAssets: 

- s[Token] (Staked Token)

- sc[Token] (Staked Compound Token)

With s[Token] and sc[Token], holders can earn block rewards while maintaining liquidity and fungibility.

The difference between the two tokens is how they manage the staking rewards:

- s[Token]'s rewards are sent continuously to a reward contract from which users can claim their rewards.

- sc[Token]'s rewards are compounded: Acquired rewards are re-staked, increasing the underlying amount of staked Token.
