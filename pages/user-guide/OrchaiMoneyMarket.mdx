## Overview
Orchai Money Market is an Anchor-inspired lending protocol that enables depositing and borrowing of stablecoins. Lenders have the ability to deposit their stablecoins to earn interest, while borrowers can borrow in an over-collateralized manner.

Orchai Money Market is permissionless to use and allows DeFi users to:
- Instantly borrow from a money market using their sAssets as collateral

- Instantly supply and withdraw stablecoin from the money market to earn lending yield

- Buy sAssets with a discount by participating in the liquidation

- Have a live and transparent view of interest rates around the clock based on the asset's market supply and demand
Orchaiâ€™s main objectives are security, capital efficiency, and user experience. Hence, instead of being able to borrow any asset from a pooled set of assets, Orchai users will only be able to borrow one stablecoin, which is USDT. This is also known as a single borrowable asset
