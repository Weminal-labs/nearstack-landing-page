## Borrowing
Tokens can be borrowed from the money market by creating a loan position with whitelisted sAssets as collateral. An account can only own a single loan position, though a user may create more loan positions with the use of multiple accounts.

sAssets collaterals are locked to open a loan position. Users are allowed to lock multiple sAsset types to a single position, diversifying collateral price exposure

### Borrow Limit
Borrows can be made until the user's liability reaches their position's borrow limit. The borrow limit is yielded as the sum of locked collateral value, times the maximum LTV ratio of collateral:
One should observe that the borrow limit fluctuates with the oracle-reported sAsset price. Loan positions with a liability higher than their borrow limit are subject to liquidation, where their collaterals are converted to stablecoins to repay their liabilities.

To prevent liquidation, borrowers can lock additional collateral to their position and increase their borrow limit. Collaterals can also be unlocked and withdrawn from a loan position, as long as the borrower's liability does not exceed the position's borrow limit.

Borrowing Interest Rate
Tokens borrowed from a market all follow a unified, algorithmically determined borrow rate. The applied borrow rate constantly adjusts based on the market supply and demand, set to increase as a function of the utilization ratio.

### Utilization Rate
Utilization Rate (U), (U) is an indicator of the availability of capital within the pool, at time t, t is caculated as:
A high utilization rate indicates that a lot of borrowing has occurred, while a low ratio indicates the opposite.

The interest rate model manages liquidity risk in the protocol through user incentives to support liquidity:
