## The Original Idea Behind Wemical

DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, is an important part of blockchain technology that has grown a lot in recent years.

These days, DeFi is trying to improve in two main ways:

1. Making it work for more people (scalability)
2. Making it easier to use (usability)

One way to achieve these goals is through "low-code" development. Low-code is a way of creating software that's becoming popular in many areas of technology, including DeFi. It means that people can build and use DeFi applications without needing to know complex programming.

## How is low-code technology used in DeFi?
In the world of DeFi (Decentralized Finance), low-code technology is becoming more popular. It's being used in many apps and platforms to make DeFi easier for everyone to use and understand. 

Low-code in DeFi means using special tools that make it simpler to create DeFi apps. These tools let developers build apps by using ready-made parts and visual tools, instead of writing complicated code from scratch. This approach makes it faster and easier to create DeFi apps, opening up the field to more people.

## How can low-code technology help improve DeFi investing?
Low-code technology can help DeFi users improve their investing in several ways:

- Personalized strategies: Users can create investment plans that fit their goals and risk comfort level. This can help increase profits while lowering risk.
- Automatic investing: Low-code tools can run investment strategies automatically. This makes managing investments easier and can help reduce costs and increase returns.
- Connecting different platforms: Users can access more investment options by connecting various DeFi platforms. This helps spread out investments and lower risk.
- Smart contracts: These are special programs that can automatically handle tasks like adjusting investments or making trades. They help make investing more transparent and efficient by reducing the need for middlemen.

We aim to be a hub in making DeFi management easier. We do this by using simple tools that don't require complex coding.  In particular, we give DeFi users the ability to create their own custom transactions with two main features:

- drag-and-drop protocols: The platform provides users with an all-in-one solution for interacting with multiple protocols, featuring a drag-and-drop UI that makes it easy and intuitive to create customizable transactions.
- AI application: The AI algorithms are applied to provide users with personalized recommendations for investment strategies and automate specific actions based on market fluctuations or users’ profiles on DeFi protocols.

To achieve the goals, Wemical team drew  a mechanism of combinator which… . This is the core of the Wemical Protocol. With the idea, Wemical Team had started to work days and nights to carry out the perfect product that suits the Aptos ecosystem
